Morethan a visit, it's an immersive and sensitive experience during whichvisitors interfere in the daily life of bourgeois in the time of Louis XV.<br /><br /><b>The visit consisted of 4 workshops</b>, each based on the differentrhythms of the day: getting up, having lunch, afternoon games andreception in the evening. Visitors were invited to discover the codes ofthe court's pageantry and social life: how to put on a wig? What types ofperfumes and makeup were used and how were they applied? What games werewe playing at that time while having tea? And many other themes. A periodtea room in partnership with a pastry chef from Versailles where young andold could come and eat throughout the event was also set up. <br /><br />With the association's team, I participated in all stages of the event:conception, promotion, management, production of mediation tools andexperience implementation."
