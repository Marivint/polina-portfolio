More than a visit, it's an immersive and sensitive experience during which visitors interfere in the daily life of bourgeois in the time of Louis XV.<br /><br /><b>The visit consisted of 4 workshops</b>, each based on the different rhythms of the day: getting up, having lunch, afternoon games and reception in the evening. Visitors were invited to discover the codes of the court's pageantry and social life: how to put on a wig? What types of perfumes and makeup were used and how were they applied? What games were we playing at that time while having tea? And many other themes. A period tea room in partnership with a pastry chef from Versailles where young and old could come and eat throughout the event was also set up. <br /><br />With the association's team, I participated in all stages of the event: conception, promotion, management, production of mediation tools and experience implementation."

If the ship was lost at sea, the sailors released the bird. When it returned back, it meant there is noland nearby, but if it flew away in a certain direction, it meant the bird found land.<br /><br />Modern city dwellers, like medieval sailors, are looking for landmarks in life. And everyone finds something of their own: unique places, recognition, art, love..."
